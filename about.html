								<h3>The Founders</h3>
							</header>
							<p><a name="accalia"></a><strong>Accalia DeElementia</strong> is the development expert and co-founder of SockDrawer. She took up the challenge of building forum bots for a new generation of forums, and she's been the one obsessing over getting the architecture just right. Without her, none of this would have happened.</p>
							<p><a name="yami"></a><strong>Yamikuronue</strong> is the testing expert and co-founder of SockDrawer. She was brought in to explain "how the heck you test this thing anyway", and stayed for the chance to learn Node.JS. Without her, SockDrawer's pace would never have been sustainable.</p>
