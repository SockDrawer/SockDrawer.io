										<h3>SockBot</h3>
									</header>
									<p>They said we couldn't do it: Javascript-based forums were 100% bot proof. We proved them wrong. Now SockBot is a cross-platform forum bot architecture, making it easy to run your own dicebot, auto-responder, or whatever you want. Add a little personality to your forums today!</p>

										<h3>ServerCooties</h3>
									</header>
									<p>"Is the forum down again, or just me?" People flooded into IRC every time the forums went offline, wondering if their crappy internet was the culprit. So we created ServerCooties.com to monitor the "cooties" that brought our server down every week.</p>
