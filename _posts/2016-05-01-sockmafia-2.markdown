Announcing: SockMafia 2.0!
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/sockmafia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sockmafia)


## FAQ

### What happened to 1.0? 
It's on Github, but we never released it to NPM

### How do I install this?
Now that we're on NPM, the easiest way to get a bot running is with the following simple steps:

1. `npm install -g sockbot`
2. `npm install -g sockmafia`
3. Create a `config.yml` file using the below template:


```yaml
---
core:
  username: mafiabot
  password: mafiapassword
  owner: ownerAccount
plugins:
  'sockmafia':
    thread: 52778
    mods:
     - mod
    players:
     - player1
     - player2
    db: './mafiadb'
    name: testMafia
    voteBars: bastard
```


4. run `sockbot config.yml`

Tadah!

### What features are included in this release?

- Voting and vote tracking
- Loved, Hated, and Doublevoter properties
- Vote bar configuration options (Bastard bars for weng-style; `open` for visible vote totals; `hidden` for no leaking.)

None of the other upcoming features made it in time for Accalia's game, but I figured I'd go ahead and release.
