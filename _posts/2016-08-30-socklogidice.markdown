This is a feature-for-feature port of the dice rolling module for LogiDice, my IRC bot. 

Sample usage: 

`!roll 1d6` for one 6-sided dice

`!roll 6x4d6` for six sets of four six-sided dice

`!roll 2dF` or `!rollfate 2` to roll 2 "fate dice" (six-sided dice with sides labelled +, -, and 0)


## Update: 

I have released The Less Spammy Release, which wraps die rolls in spoiler tags to allow them to be collapsed. A better templating engine is coming soon.
