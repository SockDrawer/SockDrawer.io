- [d555107](https://github.com/AccaliaDeElementia/SockBot/commit/d555107dce773cc6d7d16bb12a4899e7fa7c72cb) - `updates to sockmodules`

### Changes:

- SockBot will refuse to load sock_modules if they do not default to being disabled
- SockBot expects a command line argument for a configuration file. This allows multiple bots to share the same install folder
- Sockbot will refuse to load pages from TheDailyWTF faster than a maximum of 4 requests/second.
    - This is implemented via a busy wait that wastes CPU but guarantees that no processing by SockBot occurs during this delay
- Add functionality to get all posts from a topic without wasting time oading "pages" of json. Uses a chunk size of 200 posts (so most topics can be gotten in one go)
- Add functionality to `discourse.js` to like a list of posts
- Reconfigure `notifications.js` to poll notifications every 30 seconds (90 if running in cyborg mode) separate from message-bus
- Reconfigure `notifications.js` to poll message-bus every 12 seconds (36 if running in cyborg mode)
- Allow user to turn off message-bus and notification polling indipendantly
- sock_modules changes:
 - `likes.js`
    - update to use new functionality in `discourse.js`
 - `reader.js`
    - Update to be more efficient, also slower. it'll get there eventually
